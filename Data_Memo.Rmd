## Proposed Project Timeline

* 4/18-24: Clean data and perform initial EDA
* 4/25-5/8: Split data, make recipes, fit and tune models
* 5/9-15: Collect and compare metrics, fit best model to test set and evaluate performance.
* 5/16-29: Write narratives and executive summary
* 6/5: complete project

## Overview of the Dataset

Our dataset is analyzing certain products for a superstore giant. They want to know what areas, categories, and customer segments to avoid in order to have the highest sales or profit. They also want to know which products to focus on. 
<br><br>
Each row represents a customer transaction for a specific product, and the columns (variables) give information about the transaction. The variables include: 

* product name
* product sales
* quantity of the product sold (to specific customer)
* discounts
* profit or loss incurred from the sale of the specific product. 

Along with this information, there is also buyer information including customer name, city and state residence of the customer, and region where the customer resides.
<br><br>
This dataset is a simple download from Kaggle. It contains almost 10,000 observations and 21 variables. 
<br><br>
There is no need to join any data sources together. There does not appear to be any missingness in the dataset. It is very cleaned and useable.

## Potential Research Questions

The profit from each transaction greatly varied. Since the store's objective is to maximize profit, I think it would be interesting to answer the following: 

* How can we best predict profit given information about a particular transaction?
* Which properties of a particular transaction have the largest effect on predicted profit?
* Are there any significant interactions between properties that affect profit? 

This is a **predictive question** since we want to predict profitâ€”we don't care how we get to this prediction, we just want an accurate profit prediction. Since the response variable, profit, is numeric, this is a regression problem. We suspect that useful variables to predict price would be product name, product category, quantity sold, and sales.

## Difficulties
Some difficulties we might face could be regarding the time it takes to run all of the models with such a large database. In order to increase accuracy, we can increase the number of folds and repetitions for the models, but that might increase the time it takes for the models to finish running. 
<br>
In addition, it may also be difficult to assess date variables (e.g. shipping date) as a part of our model recipe. A way to combat this is to change the date into strings noting the specific month, year or day of the week.
